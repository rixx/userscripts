# rixx's Userscript Collection

This is a collection of userscripts I wrote for various websites. They are usually very tailored to me, but you can
install them from their URL directly if you’d like to.

Userscripts are JavaScript files that your browser can execute on the specified sites. You’ll need a userscript
manager like [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to run them. You can paste them in and modify them, or
install them from their URL in order to get updates.
